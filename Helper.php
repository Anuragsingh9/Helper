Coupling: coupling means how one module or object depends upon another object.
Cohesion: cohesion means how elements are grouped together in a module.
 Coupling should be always be loose coupling for better performence and cohesion should be high.


 First the model should be filled with fillables in model file.
 Then controller should be made and inside that we need to define the function in which all the logics should be there.
 We add the parameters and the accordingly response is shown.
 Then we have resource file in which we add the property which we need to show in the response.
 and this resource file will return the response which will be taken by controller function.

 added the functionality to where we can search the task according to the schedule_time of the task

Aggregation-- one or more  class is dependent on one main class

Composition -- One class is directly dependent on each other. if one is gone other also gone.

Association -- two classes are not dependent on each other. but they come together to perform a task.
